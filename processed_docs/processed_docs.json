    "content": "What is an API?\nAn API is an interface that makes it easy for one application to consume capabilities or\n  data from another application. By defining stable, simplified entry points to application logic\n  and data, APIs enable developers to easily access and reuse application logic built by other\n  developers. In the case of Web APIs, that logic and data is exposed over the network.\nSince applications that consume APIs are sensitive to changes, APIs also imply a contract.\n  The contract provides some level of assurance that, over time, the API will change in a\n  predictable manner.\nApigee enables you to build APIs and if you have APIs already, expose them directly,\n  while adding a management and visibility layer. If you have HTTP enabled services, such as\n  SOA-based Web services, they can also be exposed as APIs via Apigee.\nApigee also enables you to build APIs by implementing applications hosted on the API Services",

API proxies decouple the\n  app-facing API from your backend services, shielding those apps from backend code\n  changes.

This policy ensures that API keys are valid, have\n  not been revoked, and are approved to consume the specific resources associated with your API\n  products.\nThis policy is an Extensible policy and use of this policy might have cost or\n    utilization implications, depending on your Apigee license. For information on policy types\n    and usage implications, see\n  Policy types.\nFor a tutorial showing how to build an API proxy that uses the Verify API Key policy, see\n    Secure an API by requiring API keys.\n  \nSamples",

You can see the app's consumer key and secret pair in the Apigee UI or access them\n  from the Apigee API.   \nNote: API keys go by many names. You may see them referred to as 'API\n  keys', 'app keys', and 'consumer keys'. All of these names are synonymous.\nAt the time of app registration, the developer selects one or more API products to\n  associate with the app, where an API product is a collection of resources\n  accessible through API proxies. The developer then passes the API key (consumer key) as part of\n  every request to an API in an API product associated with the app. See Publishing overview for more.\nAPI keys can be used as authentication tokens, or they can be used to obtain OAuth access\n  tokens. In OAuth, API keys are referred to as \"client id\". The names can be used interchangeably.\n  See OAuth home for more.",

Let's say you have an app\n      where the user enters their name in an HTML form and submits it. You want the API proxy to\n      extract the form data and dynamically add it to the URL used to call the backend service. How\n      would you do this in a JavsScript policy?\nNote: If you want to try out this example, we assume you've created a new\n      proxy in the proxy editor. When you create it, just give it a backend service URL of:\n      http://www.example.com. For this example, we're going to rewrite the backend URL dynamically.\n      If you don't know how to create a new proxy, refer to the getting started tutorial.",

CORS is a commonly implemented solution to the\n    same-origin policy\n    that is enforced by all browsers.\n  \n\n    For example, if you make an XHR call to the Twitter API from JavaScript code executing in your\n    browser, the call will fail. This is because the domain serving the page to your browser is not\n    the same as the domain serving the Twitter API. CORS provides a solution to this problem by\n    allowing servers to opt-in if they wish to provide cross-origin resource sharing.",

A drawback of\n        this approach is that multiple legitimate requests coming in over a short time\n    interval can potentially be denied.\nFor example, say you enter a rate of 30pm (30 requests per minute). In testing, you might\n  think you could send 30 requests in 1 second, as long as they came within a minute. But that's\n  not how the policy enforces the setting.

The Quota policy maintains counters that tally the number of\n  requests received by the API proxy. This capability enables API providers to enforce limits on\n  the number of API calls made by apps over an interval of time. Using Quota policies you can, for\n  example, limit apps to 1 request per minute, or to 10,000 requests per month.\nThis policy is an Extensible policy and use of this policy might have cost or\n    utilization implications, depending on your Apigee license. For information on policy types\n    and usage implications, see\n  Policy types.\nWhen an API proxy reaches its quota limit, Apigee\n    rejects subsequent API calls and returns an error message  until the Quota counter\n    automatically resets at the end of the specified time interval, or until the Quota is explicitly\n    reset using the ResetQuota policy.",

It doesn't matter whether 10,000 messages were counted on the first\n  day or the last day of that month.\nWith Apigee, each API call can be dynamically weighted. For example, with a Large\n    Language Model (LLM) API, you can enforce a rate limit based on the number of tokens in\n    the request or the response, or both.

The fault response can consist of HTTP headers, query\n  parameters, and a message payload. A custom fault response can be more useful to app developers\n  and app end users than generic error messages or HTTP response codes.\nWhen executed, the RaiseFault policy transfers control from the current flow to the Error\n  flow, which then returns the designated fault response to the requesting client app. When the\n  message Flow switches to the Error flow, no further policy processing occurs.

Regular expressions enable content to be programmatically\n  evaluated for patterns. Regular expressions can be used, for example, to evaluate an email address\n  to ensure that it is properly structured. For more information, see Regular\n  Expressions in the Java Tutorials.\nThe most common usage of RegularExpressionProtection is the evaluation of JSON and XML\n  payloads for malicious content.\nNo regular expression can eliminate all content-based attacks, and multiple mechanisms should\n  be combined to enable defense-in-depth.
