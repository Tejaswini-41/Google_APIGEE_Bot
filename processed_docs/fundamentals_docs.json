By defining stable, simplified entry points to application logic\n  and data, APIs enable developers to easily access and reuse application logic built by other\n  developers. In the case of Web APIs, that logic and data is exposed over the network.\nSince applications that consume APIs are sensitive to changes, APIs also imply a contract.\n  The contract provides some level of assurance that, over time, the API will change in a\n  predictable manner.\nApigee enables you to build APIs and if you have APIs already, expose them directly,\n  while adding a management and visibility layer. If you have HTTP enabled services, such as\n  SOA-based Web services, they can also be exposed as APIs via Apigee.\nApigee also enables you to build APIs by implementing applications hosted on the API Services",
